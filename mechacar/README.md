# MechaCar Analysis

This is an analysis of fictional MechaCar prototypes in production. There is also a statistical testing demo in R in `stat_tests.R`.

## Data
- `MechaCar_mpg.csv` - fuel economy (MPG) test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance.
- `Suspension_Coil.csv` - results from multiple production lots. The weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across each lot. The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch (PSI).
- `used_car_data.csv` and `mpg_data.csv` contain demo data for the R demo in `stat_tests.R`
